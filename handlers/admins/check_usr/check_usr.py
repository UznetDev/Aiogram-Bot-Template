async def check_user(call: types.CallbackQuery, state: FSMContext):
    """
    Handles the process of checking a user's details by an admin in a Telegram bot.

    Parameters:
    - call (types.CallbackQuery): The callback query object containing details about the callback.
    - state (FSMContext): Finite State Machine context used to manage user states.

    Functionality:
    - Retrieves the admin's ID and message details from the callback query.
    - Uses the admin's ID to verify if they have the necessary permissions to check a user's details.
    - If the admin is authorized, prompts them to send the user ID they want to check.
    - If not authorized, sends a message indicating that the admin lacks the required permissions.
    - Updates the admin's state to `AdminState.check_user` and the state data with the message ID.
    - Edits the original message with the result of the check.
    - Logs any exceptions that occur during execution.

    Returns:
    - This function is asynchronous and does not return a value but performs actions such as sending messages and updating states.
