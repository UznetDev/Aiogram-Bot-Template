async def add_admin_first(call: types.CallbackQuery, state: FSMContext):
    """
    Handles the initial request to add a new admin.

    Parameters:
    - call (types.CallbackQuery): The callback query object from the admin's interaction.
    - state (FSMContext): The FSM context to manage the bot's state during the conversation.

    Functionality:
    - Retrieves the ID of the admin who initiated the request (`user_id`), the message ID (`mid`), and the language code (`lang`).
    - Checks if the requesting admin has the rights to add a new admin.
    - If the requesting admin has the necessary permissions, prompts them to send the ID of the new admin to be added.
    - Sets the state to `AdminState.add_admin` to handle the next step of the process.
    - If the requesting admin does not have the necessary permissions, sends a message indicating lack of rights.
    - Updates the original message with the appropriate response and buttons based on the outcome.

    Returns:
    - This function is asynchronous and does not return a value. It interacts with the Telegram API to update messages and manage the state.

    Error Handling:
    - Catches and logs any exceptions that occur during the process of handling the callback query or updating the message.
