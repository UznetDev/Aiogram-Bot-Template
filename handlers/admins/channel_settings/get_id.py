async def add_channel2(msg: types.Message, state: FSMContext):
    """
    Handles the addition of a new channel to the bot's database by an authorized admin.

    Parameters:
    - msg (types.Message): The message object containing the channel ID input by the user.
    - state (FSMContext): FSM context used to manage the bot's state for the current conversation.

    Functionality:
    - Retrieves the admin's user ID (`user_ud`), the message ID (`mid`), and the language code (`lang`) from the message.
    - Checks if the user has the necessary permissions to manage channel settings using the `SelectAdmin` filter.
    - If authorized, attempts to convert the input text into a channel ID, checks if the channel is already in the database, and adds it if not.
    - If the channel is already in the database, provides details about the existing entry.
    - If the bot is not an admin in the channel or other errors occur, logs the error and informs the user.
    - Clears the state and updates the bot message with the result of the operation and a close button (`close_btn`).
    - Catches and logs any exceptions that occur during the execution.

    Returns:
    - This function is asynchronous and does not return a value. It interacts with the Telegram API to send and edit messages.
